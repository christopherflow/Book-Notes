The Book Of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi: 	5/2/21


Be Vigilant with your posture of body and mind.
Be Diligent with your practice
Without the above, your spirit will be confused


Thought The book conjured:


When playing piano, a beginner will have to think much to transition from chord to chord, causing his spirit to be confused throughout the progression. 
However, with practice, there is less thought, less activity of mind that is coordinated to formulating memory on the certain position on hand. When the master plays, 
the lack of thought allocated to forming memory can allow him to flow, move naturally. 
The body completes the commands of the mind the way the body naturally does. With this, your mind can be balanced. 

Consider your mind to be a particle moving up and down, and the resulting movement is represented in waves, similar to graphical representation of sound. And spirit is a set formation, a current, 
that when the waves are synchronized in a certain fashion, the mind and spirit become into harmony through the logarithm of rhythm of waves approaching the outlined current. 
This is only possible if you have done the consistent work, and the body does not fuzz the mind, confusing the spirit. 


YOU MUST PRACTICE CONSISTENTLY



This is a brief and incomplete summary. The book is a masterpiece. Read it.
